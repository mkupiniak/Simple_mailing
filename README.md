#Mail template from PSD to HTML

###This is my first mail template that is styled with a table elements for proper rendering in different browsers or email clients.

Every client, webmail or mobile mail app has its own style of rendering the emails. So it is very important not to use divs as they don't hold their structure but use tables instead. What is more above mentioned don't also support external CSS and have problems with styles within `<head>` section so everything is inline styled. It doesn't look good and the code seems messy (well... it is actually), but it works.
