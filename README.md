#Mail template from PSD to HTML

###This is a mail template that is styled with table elements for proper rendering in different webmails and email clients.

Every client, webmail or mobile mail app has its own style of rendering the emails. So it is very important not to use divs as they don't hold their structure but to use tables instead. What is more, the above mentioned, don't also support external CSS and have problems with styles within `<head>` section so everything must be inline styled. Maybe the code doesn't look good and seems messy (well... it is actually), but it works.
